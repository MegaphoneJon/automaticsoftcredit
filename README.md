This CiviCRM extension allows you to define a relationship type (e.g. "Automatically Soft Credits/is Automatically Soft Credited By") which, when a contact A having this relationship makes any contribution, contact B is automatically soft credited for the full amount.

Install as any other CiviCRM Extension, then go to *Administer menu > Customize Data and Screens > Automatic Soft Credits*.  Specify the relationship type ID used for automatic soft crediting and enjoy!

RELEASE NOTES:
* This extension has only been tested on CiviCRM 4.6, but is likely to work on earlier/later versions.  Older versions (not tagged, sorry) were written to work with Civi 4.4.
* This is the alpha version - the core functionality works, but the settings menu does not.  For now, the relationship type id is hardcoded in automaticsoftcredits.php.
